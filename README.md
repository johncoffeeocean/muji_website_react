Muji (無印良品, Mujirushi Ryōhin) is a Japanese retail company which sells a wide variety of household and consumer goods.

Muji's design philosophy is minimalist, and it places an emphasis on recycling, reducing production and packaging waste,  
and a **no-logo** or **"no-brand" policy**.

Because of its design gives me a basic but also luxury experience, I decided to open this ecommerce clone project :heart:
